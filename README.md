# Interactive-MNIST
 
### About the project:
Interactive-MNIST allows the user to interact with a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). The user draws a number in a 28x28 'pixel' grid, which will then be evaluated and the CNN's prediction will be displayed on the screen.

Interactive-MNIST also has a file to train the model(Train_MNIST.py) and a file to edit the model(ConvNetMNIST.py) for those who are interested in making changes.


### Dependencies:
The project was created using python 3.11 and all the dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
